## FOR ANYONE REVIEWING THIS CODE
This project is a collaboration between me, Matthew Law, Alex Fall, and Erick Daleon. While we all had a hand in writing all of the code, the particular areas I was involved in are as follows:

 Pair-programmed with Matthew Law: GooController.cs, PracticeCompute.compute, EntropyShader.compute (available in Scripts/Compute folder)
 Responsible for: Level.cs, StaticDestructable.cs, DynamicDestructable.cs (these are all available in the Shared/Scripts folder)
